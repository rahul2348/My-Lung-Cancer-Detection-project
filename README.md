# My-Lung-Cancer-Detection-project
Project Description:
This project develops a deep learning pipeline for the automated classification of lung cancer types from medical images. Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system is trained to distinguish between four key categories: adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, normal tissue, and squamous cell carcinoma.

The workflow begins with robust data loading and preprocessing, including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model generalization. The pipeline features advanced handling of class imbalance through the application of class weights, ensuring balanced learning across all categories. The core model architecture comprises multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers with dropout for regularization, optimized for high-dimensional medical image data.

Training is conducted using K-fold cross-validation to reliably assess model performance, with early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks to prevent overfitting and improve convergence. The system achieves strong validation accuracy, demonstrating its potential for assisting in early and accurate lung cancer diagnosis from imaging data.

This description highlights the technical approach, data handling strategies, model architecture, and validation methods used in your project.
